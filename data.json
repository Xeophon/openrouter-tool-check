              "response_content": "The weather in London is famously changeable year-round due to its **temperate maritime climate**. Here's a general overview:\n\n1.  **Summer (June\u2013August):**  \n    *   **Typical:** Mild to warm (average highs around 20\u201324\u00b0C / 68\u201375\u00b0F).  \n    *   **Variable:** Can occasionally experience heatwaves (reaching 30\u00b0C+ / 86\u00b0F+) or cooler, grey days.  \n    *   **Sunshine:** Most sunshine of the year, but still variable. Expect significantly longer daylight hours.\n    *   **Rain:** Showers or thunderstorms possible anytime.\n\n2.  **Autumn (September\u2013November):**  \n    *   **Typical:** Gradually cooling (September often pleasant). Increasingly wet and windy.  \n    *   **Temperatures:** Average highs drop from 19\u00b0C (66\u00b0F) in Sept to 9\u00b0C (48\u00b0F) in Nov.  \n    *   **Rain:** Rainfall amounts increase as the season progresses.\n\n3.  **Winter (December\u2013February):**  \n    *   **Typical:** Cool to cold, damp, and often overcast.  \n    *   **Temperatures:** Average highs are 7\u20139\u00b0C (45\u201348\u00b0F), lows around 2\u20134\u00b0C (36\u201339\u00b0F). Frost occurs, snow is relatively rare (1\u20132 settled days per year in central London) but impactful when it happens.  \n    *   **Rain:** Frequent drizzle and rain showers. Daylight hours are short.  \n    *   **Wind:** Can feel significantly colder due to wind chill (\"gritty\" damp cold feeling).\n\n4.  **Spring (March\u2013May):**  \n    *   **Typical:** Gradual warming. Increasing sunshine, but still frequent showers.  \n    *   **Temperatures:** Average highs rise from 11\u00b0C (52\u00b0F) in Mar to 17\u00b0C (63\u00b0F) in May. Frost possible early on.  \n    *   **Variable:** Expect rapid swings between sunny, pleasant days and cooler, wet periods.\n\n**Key Characteristics Year-Round:**\n\n*   **Unpredictability:** \"Four seasons in one day\" is a common phrase. Always be prepared for change.\n*   **Rain:** Can happen any time, any season. It's rarely torrential for long periods (more often persistent drizzle or short showers). The driest months tend to be early spring (February-May).\n*   **Humidity/Mist:** Common, contributing to the cool, damp feel.\n*   **Cloud Cover:** Often cloudy or overcast, especially November to February.\n*   **London Effect:** The \"urban heat island\" means central London is often several degrees warmer than surrounding countryside, receives less frost/snow, and rainfall can be marginally less intense.\n\n**What to Pack/Do (Generally):**\n\n*   **ALWAYS carry layers** - a good jacket/cardigan/sweater you can take off or put on easily. Weather changes quickly.\n*   **Bring an umbrella or waterproof jacket** - essential year-round.\n*   Comfortable walking shoes (with water resistance for potential puddles).\n*   Sunscreen is useful surprisingly often, especially in spring/summer, even when cloudy.\n*   Check a **reliable real",

Here\u2019s a brief summary of what to expect in different seasons:\n\n- **Spring (March to May):** Spring in London typically brings warmer temperatures compared to winter, but it can still get cool, particularly at night. You can see some greenery as plants start to bloom. Spring is quite rainy, so you might experience a few showers.\n\n- **Summer (June to August):** Summer in London is warm with temperatures ranging from 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (60\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F), though it can be cooler in the evenings. The weather can be quite varied, with sunny spells and thunderstorms. It tends to be one of the drier times of year, though it can still be wet.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November):** Autumn brings cooler temperatures and increasing rainfall. Leaves on the trees turn colors and fall as the weather gets more changeable. By November, many leaves have already fallen, and temperatures are significantly cooler.\n\n- **Winter (December to February):** Winters in London are cool, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing. However, there can be occasional frosts and fog. London is usually wet during winter, and it can rain at any time, so it's a good idea to carry an umbrella.\n\nFor the most up-to-date and precise weather forecast, please check a reliable weather website or app.",

It can be unpredictable with occasional showers.\n\n- **Summer (June to August)**: Warmest months with average temperatures ranging from 12\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (54\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F). There's a chance of sunny spells but also periods of rain.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November)**: Similar temperature range as spring, dropping slowly as winter approaches. Expect more overcast and wet days.\n\n- **Winter (December to February)**: Coldest months with averages of 3\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (37\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Snow is rare but does occur; it tends to bring icy conditions to the city.\n\nOverall, London typically experiences mild temperatures throughout the year, with plenty of rainfall distributed fairly evenly across seasons.

However, it can feel warmer on sunny days due to the urban heat island effect. Summers can also be quite rainy.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November):** Similar to spring, with temperatures around 9\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C (48\u00b0F to 61\u00b0F). It can be damp and overcast, with a high chance of fog.\n\n- **Winter (December to February):** Cooler with temperatures usually between 3\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (37\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F).
