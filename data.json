              "response_content": "The weather in London is famously **changeable** and **temperate**, characterised by **mild temperatures year-round, frequent drizzle/showers, and relatively modest extremes**. Here's a breakdown of what to expect overall, *without real-time data* (since my training data only goes up until July 2024 and I can't access live weather):\n\n1.  **Mild Temperatures:** London rarely experiences severe cold or intense heat.\n    *   **Summer (June-Aug):** Average highs around 20-23\u00b0C (68-73\u00b0F). Heatwaves can push this into the high 20s or low 30s\u00b0C (80s\u00b0F), but they rarely last long. Nights stay cool, around 12-15\u00b0C (54-59\u00b0F). It's the sunniest season, but rain is still common.\n    *   **Spring (Mar-May) & Autumn (Sept-Nov):** Temperatures are pleasantly cool, ranging from lows around 6-11\u00b0C (43-52\u00b0F) to highs around 12-18\u00b0C (54-64\u00b0F). These seasons often have the most settled weather, but showers are frequent.\n    *   **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Usually damp rather than bitterly cold. Average highs around 8-10\u00b0C (46-50\u00b0F) and lows around 2-4\u00b0C (36-39\u00b0F). Snow is possible but relatively infrequent and doesn't usually lie for long; frost is more common. Rain is frequent.\n\n2.  **Frequent Rain/Showers:** While London isn't the wettest city in Europe or even the UK, **precipitation is frequent year-round**. You're more likely to encounter drizzle or short, light showers than prolonged heavy downpours. Always be prepared for rain! There's no single \"rainy season\" \u2013 rain can fall at any time.\n\n3.  **Variable Skies (\"Four Seasons in One Day\"):** This is a quintessential London experience. Sunshine, cloud, and passing showers can alternate rapidly, especially in spring and autumn. Don't be fooled by a sunny morning \u2013 carry layers and an umbrella.\n\n4.  **Low Probability of Severe Weather:** Extreme cold, heatwaves, heavy snowstorms, damaging storms, or thick fog happen, but they are uncommon and usually short-lived when they occur.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **Expect mild temperatures.**\n*   **Expect the possibility of rain/drizzle at ANY time of year.**\n*   **Expect the weather to change quickly during the day.**\n*   **Seasons are distinct but not extreme.**\n\n**Practical Tips:**\n\n*   **Always carry an umbrella or a waterproof jacket/layer.**\n*   **Dress in layers** so you can easily adapt to changing conditions.\n*   **Check a reliable near-real-time source** like the Met Office ([https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)), BBC Weather, or a trusted weather app for forecasts and current conditions, especially for planning specific outdoor activities.\n\n**While I can't give you the current forecast right now, the description above covers the *typical* London weather experience, making \"changeable with a chance of rain\" the safest bet!**",

However, it's known for being **unpredictable** and can change quickly throughout the day. Here's a general overview:\n\n- **Spring (March\u2013May):** Variable, with temperatures ranging from 8\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C (46\u00b0F\u201364\u00b0F). Rain is common, and there may be sudden temperature fluctuations.\n- **Summer (June\u2013August):** Warmest season, with average highs of 20\u00b0C\u201325\u00b0C (68\u00b0F\u201377\u00b0F). Occasional heatwaves, but also frequent rain showers.\n- **Autumn (September\u2013November):** Cooler and wetter, with temperatures dropping to 10\u00b0C\u201315\u00b0C (50\u00b0F\u201359\u00b0F). More wind and rain as the season progresses.\n- **Winter (December\u2013February):** Coldest, with temperatures averaging 4\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C (39\u00b0F\u201346\u00b0F). Rain is common, and frost or snow is rare but possible.\n\nFor real-time updates, I recommend checking a reliable weather service like the **Met Office** (UK's official weather provider) or apps like **AccuWeather** or **Weather.com**. Let me know if you'd like tips for packing based on the season!",

Here's a general overview:\n\n- **Summers (June\u2013August):** Warm but often overcast, with average highs of 20\u201325\u00b0C (68\u201377\u00b0F). Rain is possible, and temperatures rarely exceed 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F).\n- **Winters (December\u2013February):** Cool and damp, with average highs of 4\u20138\u00b0C (39\u201346\u00b0F) and lows around 0\u20134\u00b0C (32\u201339\u00b0F). Snow is rare but not unheard of, especially in January.\n- **Spring/Fall (March\u2013May, September\u2013November):** Unpredictable, with fluctuating temperatures. Spring can have sudden bursts of warmth or chilly days, while fall often brings cooler, wetter conditions.\n\n**Key Notes:**\n- Rain is common year-round, so a light umbrella or waterproof jacket is wise.\n- Fog was historically more frequent (e.g., the 1952 Great Smog), but air quality has improved, making dense fog rare now.\n- Microclimates exist within the city, so conditions can vary between areas.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, check a reliable weather service like the **Met Office** (UK's national weather agency) or a real-time app. Always be prepared for sudden changes! \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f",
