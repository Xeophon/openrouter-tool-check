We can default to 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'? \n However, the user is likely in the US, so we might choose fahrenheit. But the user hasn't specified. Since the function allows both and the question doesn't specify, we can either:\n a) Ask the user for the preferred unit? -> But that would require another step.\n b) Choose a default. The problem is the function requires the unit. So we must choose one? \n\n Let me reconsider: the function parameters require 'location'. The 'unit' is not required (only location is in the required list). \n However, looking at the function definition, the 'unit' property is not in the required array? Let me check:\n\n The function definition says:\n   \"required\": [\n        \"location\"\n    ]\n\n So only location is required. Therefore, we can call the function without the unit? \n But wait: the function might not be able to return without a unit? Or the unit might default to something? The function's description doesn't say.\n\n However, note that in the function's parameters, the unit is an enum and it's not marked as required. Therefore, we can omit it. \n The instructions say: \"You can use the following functions to solve my question\". So if the unit is optional, we can call without.\n\n Given the above, let's call the function with location only? Or provide a default unit? The function might require one if it's designed that way? \n\n But the tool specification doesn't require the unit. So we are allowed to omit.\n\n Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose a common unit for the location. Since San Francisco is in the US, we can use 'fahrenheit'. \n\n However, note the user might prefer celsius. Without explicit instruction, we are going to choose fahrenheit for US locations.\n\n But: the function might have a built-in default? We don't know. Since the function specification says unit is an optional parameter, let's try without?\n\n However, the specification of the tool says that we are allowed to pass the unit? It's an enum of two. Since it's optional, we can skip.\n\n So we have two options:\n Option 1: Call get_weather with just location: \"San Francisco, CA\"\n Option 2: Call get_weather with location and unit, setting unit to 'fahrenheit' (because San Francisco is in the US).\n\n According to the tool, the only required property is location. Therefore, we are allowed to pass only location.\n\n But note: the tool might require the unit and the specification might have an error? We are going by the specification.\n\n However, let's look at the function definition again: \n   \"properties\": { ... }, \n   \"required\": [\"location\"]\n\n Therefore, the unit is NOT required. So we can call without.\n\n But what if the function fails without unit? That depends on the implementation which we don't have. So we follow the specification.\n\n Since the unit is optional, we can omit. \n\n Alternatively, if we are unsure, we might want to include a unit. But the specification says it's optional.\n\n We'll call without unit and see what the function returns.\n\n However, to be safe, perhaps the function has an implicit default (like the one used in the region). In the US, it's fahrenheit. But we don't know.\n\n How about we make a decision: if the location is in the US, use fahrenheit. But the function doesn't require it so we omit.\n\n But the problem: the function might require the unit? Because in the tool specification for the language model, it's listed as a property. However, the required array only includes location.\n\n Therefore, we can call without the unit.\n\n However, the tool call might fail if the backend requires unit? We are not the backend, so we have to go by the specification.\n\n Alternatively, we can ask the user? That would be the best practice? But the question doesn't ask for a unit, so we assume either is acceptable? \n\n Given the above, let's call the function without unit? But note: the function expects the unit to be one of the enum, but it's allowed to be missing? \n\n The specification says the unit is an enum and it's not required. So we are safe to omit.\n\n So:\n\n We will call get_weather with location = \"San Francisco, CA\", and omit the unit.\n\n But note: the location we pass must match the format? The description says: \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\". So we pass \"San Francisco, CA\".\n\n So the function call",

However, the user did not specify a unit. \n According to the tool description, the unit parameter is required? Wait, in the parameters, the required array only includes \"location\". The unit is an enum but not required. \n But note: the function's signature expects both, but unit is not required. However, we must pass a unit? Actually, the required array only lists \"location\", meaning unit is optional. \n But in practice, we need to decide on a unit. Since the user didn't specify, we can choose a default. Let's choose fahrenheit because the user is asking about San Francisco (which is in the US). \n However, note: the tool might have a built-in default? But the description doesn't say. Since the function requires a unit parameter (if not required, we can avoid passing it?), but note: the required array does not include unit, so we may omit it? \n But looking at the function definition: the parameters properties have unit as an enum and required array only has location. This means that unit is not mandatory. So we can invoke without unit? Or should we use one? \n Actually, let me check the tool's description: the function is defined to get weather and it uses unit, but if not provided it might have a default? We are not sure. To be safe, we can provide a default if the user didn't specify. \n Alternatively, we can try without unit? But the function might break. Actually, the tool specification says it's an enum and not required? How should the tool behave? \n However, the problem is we are the assistant and we have to form the function call. Since the function allows unit to be omitted, but note: the parameters are to be passed as an object. Without the unit, what will the tool do? \n Given that the unit is not in the required array, we can try calling without it. But the tool might require one? The function specification says \"required\" only location. \n So I think we can call it without the unit? \n\n But wait: the function might be implemented to require a unit? The tool description doesn't say. However, the function call doesn't make unit optional? The tool creator might have designed it to use a default if unit is absent? \n\n However, to be safe, we can set a default unit when the user doesn't specify. Let's set unit to \"fahrenheit\" for locations in the US and \"celsius\" elsewhere. But the user is asking about San Francisco, which is in the US. So we'll use \"fahrenheit\". \n\n Alternatively, the tool might have a built-in default? We don't know. But the problem is we are creating the function call. We have two choices:\n   1. Call the function without unit (if the tool allows it and the tool uses a default).\n   2. Provide a default.\n\n Since the unit is not required, we can also leave it out? But the description says the function expects two parameters? Actually, the function expects an object that must have location, and optionally unit. \n\n The assistant's function calling protocol: the call should only include parameters that we have and that are required? Only the required ones? We are allowed to send the optional ones if we know them? \n\n In this case, the user did not specify unit. So we are not sure. But to be safe, we can set a default.\n\n However, looking back: the tool definition says the unit is an enum and is a property, but it is not in the required array. So we can omit it? Then the tool might use its default? \n\n How about we try to call without unit? It's acceptable by the schema. Let's do that. \n\n But note: the assistant's function calling specification says we are to form a call with the parameters as per the schema. Since unit is optional, we can skip it.\n\n However, the original intention of the user might be to get in a particular unit? No, they didn't specify. But the typical weather in the US is reported in Fahrenheit. \n\n But to avoid an extra step, we can assume fahrenheit? And include the unit? \n\n I think the best practice is to use the typical unit for the region. But since the tool description does not specify a default, and the function doesn't require unit, we can try without and see if the tool returns? \n\n However, we have to form a call. The tool might not return without unit? \n\n Alternatively, we can look at the function description: it says the unit is an enum?

The function get_weather requires a location and optionally a unit.\n Since the user didn't specify the unit, we can choose one. Let's default to fahrenheit as it's common in the US.\n However, note that San Francisco is in the US and typically uses Fahrenheit, but we could also confirm if needed.\n But the problem says to use the functions. We'll use fahrenheit.\n\n Let's extract the location: \"San Francisco\". However, note that the function expects a city and state. \n But the user only said \"San Francisco\". We can assume they mean San Francisco, CA. \n Alternatively, we can look at the function's description: it expects a city and state. \n We don't have the state from the user. We might need to make an assumption.\n\n But note: the function doesn't require the state to be provided, so we can pass just \"San Francisco\" and hope the service understands. \n Alternatively, to be safe, we can use \"San Francisco, CA\" as the location.\n\n Since the user only said \"San Francisco\", we'll pass that. If the function requires more specificity, it might fail, but we are following the user input.\n\n Let's call the function with:\n   location: \"San Francisco\"\n   unit: \"fahrenheit\"\n\n However, note: the function requires the location. We are setting that. The unit is optional, so we can leave it out? \n But the parameter for the function includes the unit. Since we have a default in mind, we'll set it to \"fahrenheit\".\n\n Alternatively, we can see that the unit is not required (required only includes location). But the function signature in the tool has required: [\"location\"].\n\n But note: the tool call must include the parameters as per the schema. The unit is not required by the function, so we can omit it? \n However, looking at the schema: the function parameters have:\n   properties: location (required) and unit (optional because not in required)\n So we can generate the function call without unit? \n\n But note: the user did not specify the unit. We have two choices:\n   1. Omit the unit and let the function use its own default (if any).\n   2. Choose a default ourselves.\n\n However, the function description does not specify a default. In a real scenario, we might know the function or we might document it. \n But since the function is our own (we are simulating), we don't know. However, in the problem, we are the one defining the function? \n\n Actually, we are the assistant and we are calling the function. The tool call requires parameters. \n But the function definition doesn't have a default. \n\n Let's decide: We'll set unit to \"fahrenheit\" because the location is in the US.\n\n But note: the tool definition says the function takes two parameters: location (required) and unit (optional). \n We can either include unit or not. However, since the user didn't specify, and we want to get the weather, it is better to be explicit.\n\n We have to look at the function's design. How is the function implemented? We don't know. But the tool expects that we can pass the unit. \n And if we don't pass unit, the function would use a default? But the function does not require unit, so we are allowed to omit it.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the function implementation. Since we are the ones defining the tool, we can decide.\n\n Given that, we have two options in the code:\n   Option 1: Call with location: \"San Francisco\" and without unit -> leaving it to the function to choose.\n   Option 2: Choose a unit and include it.\n\n The problem says: if the user didn't specify, use a default. Since we are in the context of the tool, we can set our own.\n\n But note the tool specification allows passing unit as one of the parameters. We don't know if the function requires a unit to be passed. \n Since it is an optional parameter, we can skip it. However, for consistency, we might want to always pass the unit? \n\n Let me reexamine the tool definition: \n   \"required\": [ \"location\" ] -> meaning the only required parameter is location. Unit is optional.\n\n So we could just pass location. But then the function might use a default. \n\n However, the user didn't specify the unit, so we don't have a unit. We might set our own default? \n But the function in the tool is defined to take either celsius or fahrenheit. \n\n Since the user didn't specify, it's acceptable to use the function's default.

Maybe they're planning a trip, or perhaps they're just curious. Since they didn't provide any specific timeframe, I'll cover the general climate patterns.\n\nSan Francisco's weather is famously tricky. I remember it's all about microclimates and that iconic fog. The user might not realize how much the weather varies neighborhood to neighborhood. They could be packing for a trip and end up unprepared if I just give generic info. \n\nLet me break this down: First, the fog - it's not just a stereotype, it's real science with that cold Pacific current. I should explain how it burns off by afternoon but rolls back in hard at night. The \"Karl the Fog\" nickname might add local flavor. \n\nTemperature-wise, the range is narrow but deceptive. People see \"60s F\" and think it's warm, but with wind and fog it feels colder. I should emphasize layers - that's the golden rule for SF. Maybe mention how locals always carry jackets? \n\nOh, and seasons! Tourists expect summer heat but get shocked by our July gloom. Gotta clarify that fall is actually the warmest season. Winter being rainy but not freezing is important too. \n\nMicroclimates deserve special attention. The difference between Sunset and Mission districts can be 20 degrees! Should give concrete examples like \"oceanfront vs. downtown\" to illustrate. \n\nFor practical advice: stress layers, windbreakers, and sun protection. Maybe warn about cold summer nights - that catches so many visitors off guard. \n\nShould I mention specific months? Probably yes, since \"best time to visit\" is the unspoken question behind this. September-October gets my vote for ideal weather. \n\n...Wait, is this for today's forecast? No, they didn't ask for real-time data. But I'll note that current conditions require checking a weather app. \n\nFinal thought: Sprinkle in some local terms like \"Karl\" and \"microclimates\" to make it feel authentic. Keep it useful but friendly - they're probably excited about their trip!\n</think>\nSan Francisco's weather is famously unique and often surprising to visitors! Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Cool & Temperate Year-Round:** It rarely gets truly hot or very cold. Average highs range from the **mid-50s\u00b0F (13\u00b0C) in winter** to the **mid-60s to low 70s\u00b0F (18-23\u00b0C) in fall** (the warmest season). Lows are usually in the **40s-50s\u00b0F (5-15\u00b0C)**.\n\n2.  **The Iconic Fog (Karl the Fog):**\n    *   Especially prevalent in **summer (June-August)**.\n    *   Forms over the cold Pacific Ocean and rolls in through the Golden Gate, often blanketing western neighborhoods (Sunset, Richmond) and downtown in the morning and evening.\n    *   It often \"burns off\" inland and in eastern neighborhoods (Mission, SOMA, Potrero Hill) by the afternoon, leading to sunny skies there while the west stays cool and grey.\n    *   Creates a significant **temperature difference (10-20\u00b0F / 5-10\u00b0C)** between foggy and sunny areas.\n\n3.  **Microclimates:** This is CRUCIAL! Weather can change dramatically within just a few miles due to hills, ocean exposure, and bay influence.\n    *   **West Side (Ocean Beach, Sunset, Richmond):** Coolest, foggiest, windiest.\n    *   **Downtown/North Beach/Financial District:** Cool, often foggy in mornings/evenings.\n    *   **East Side (Mission, SOMA, Potrero Hill, Bernal Heights):** Sunnier, warmer, less foggy.\n    *   **South (Bayview, Hunters Point):** Variable, can be warmer or cooler depending on bay breezes.\n\n4.  **Windy:** It's often breezy, especially near the coast and the Golden Gate Bridge. Afternoons tend to be windier.\n\n5.  **Dry Summers, Wet Winters:**\n    *   **Summer (June-Aug):** Virtually no rain, but cool and foggy (especially west side). *This is the \"greyest\" time, not the warmest!*\n    *   **Fall (Sept-Nov):** The **warmest and sunniest** season. Fog decreases significantly. \"Indian Summer\" is common.\n    *   **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Coolest, wettest season. Rain is common (though not constant), but snow is extremely rare. Frost is possible inland on very",

Here's a quick overview:\n\n### \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f Year-Round Basics:\n- **Cool Summers:** Rarely hot (avg. 60-70\u00b0F / 15-21\u00b0C). Fog often rolls in, especially west of the city.\n- **Mild Winters:** Avg. 50-60\u00b0F (10-15\u00b0C). Rain is most common Nov\u2013Mar.\n- **Little Seasonal Extremes:** Snow/freezes are rare; heatwaves are uncommon.\n\n### \ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f Key Features:\n1. **Fog (\"Karl the Fog\"):** Frequent in summer mornings/evenings, burning off inland.\n2. **Windy:** Especially near the Golden Gate Bridge and west-facing areas.\n3. **Microclimates:**  \n   - *Sunny & Warm:* Mission, SOMA, Castro.  \n   - *Cool & Foggy:* Sunset, Richmond, Ocean Beach.  \n   - *Variable:* Downtown, North Beach.  \n4. **\"Indian Summer\":** Warmest months are often Sept\u2013Oct.\n\n### \ud83d\udccb What to Pack:\n- **Always bring layers** (light jacket/sweater + t-shirt).  \n- Avoid shorts\u2014even in summer.  \n- Sunglasses + beanie/scarf are useful year-round.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d For Right Now:\nWeather changes hourly!

Maybe they're planning a trip, packing, or just curious. Since they didn't specify, I'll cover the basics but also hint at deeper patterns.  \n\nSan Francisco's weather is tricky\u2014it's not the sunny California stereotype. Tourists often get shocked by the fog and cold summers. I should emphasize that. The microclimates are important too; someone might not realize it's 20\u00b0F colder across the Golden Gate Bridge.  \n\nThey might also care about timing. If they're visiting in September, they'd want to know it's actually warmest then. Or if they're packing for summer, they need layers. I\u2019ll structure it clearly: key traits first, then seasons, then microclimates.  \n\nOh, and the fog has a name\u2014Karl! Locals love that. Adding that touch makes it feel less robotic. And I\u2019ll end with a practical tip about layers. No fluff, just useful takeaways.  \n\nWait, should I ask if they want a forecast? Nah, that\u2019s outdated fast. Better to explain the *patterns* so they can interpret forecasts themselves. Smart.\n</think>\nSan Francisco's weather is famously unpredictable and heavily influenced by microclimates, but here are the key characteristics:\n\n### \ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f Key Traits:\n1. **Cool Summers:** Expect fog (especially mornings/evenings), wind, and highs around **60\u201370\u00b0F (15\u201321\u00b0C)**. July & August are the coldest summer months.\n2. **Mild Winters:** Rarely freezing, with highs of **55\u201360\u00b0F (13\u201316\u00b0C)**. Rain occurs mostly **November\u2013March**.\n3. **Microclimates:** Temperatures can vary by 20\u00b0F (11\u00b0C) within miles. The Sunset/Richmond districts and the coast are foggiest/coolest; downtown/east neighborhoods (e.g., Mission) are sunnier/warmer.\n4. **\"Karl the Fog\":** Persistent fog rolls in from the Pacific, often covering the Golden Gate Bridge and western neighborhoods.\n5. **Layering is Essential:** Even summer days start cool, peak mildly, and get chilly at night. Always carry a jacket!\n\n### \ud83d\udcc5 Seasonal Breakdown:\n- **Spring (Mar\u2013May):** Mix of sun and rain, highs 60\u201365\u00b0F (15\u201318\u00b0C). Blooming flowers.\n- **Summer (Jun\u2013Aug):** Foggy, windy, highs 65\u201370\u00b0F (18\u201321\u00b0C). Warmest in September (\"Indian Summer\").\n- **Fall (Sep\u2013Nov):** Warmest months (70s\u00b0F/20s\u00b0C), less fog. Rain returns late fall.\n- **Winter (Dec\u2013Feb):** Coolest (50s\u00b0F/10\u201315\u00b0C), rainy periods. Snow is extremely rare.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip:\nCheck hyperlocal forecasts (e.g., [SFGate](https://www.sfgate.com/) or [NWS Bay Area](https://www.weather.gov/mtr/)) for your specific neighborhood!  \n**Always pack layers, sunglasses, and a windbreaker\u2014no matter the season.**",

Maybe they're planning a trip, packing for a visit, or just curious. Since they didn't specify, I'll cover all bases.  \n\nFirst, I need real-time data. My knowledge cutoff is July 2024, but weather changes constantly. I should emphasize that they need to check a live source. London weather is famously unpredictable\u2014sunny one minute, raining the next.  \n\nI recall London has a temperate maritime climate: mild but changeable. Winters are cool (rarely freezing), summers warm but not hot. Rain is possible year-round, so an umbrella is always wise.  \n\nThe user might want practical advice too. Should I mention layers? Yes\u2014Londoners dress in layers because temperatures swing. Also, summer evenings can get chilly even if days are warm.  \n\nOh, and time of year matters! If they're visiting in November, they\u2019ll need a coat; in July, maybe just a light jacket. But since they didn\u2019t specify dates, I\u2019ll keep it general but suggest checking closer to their visit.  \n\nI should also warn about variability. People get caught off guard by London\u2019s \"four seasons in a day.\" A sunny morning \u2260 a dry afternoon!  \n\nFinally, I\u2019ll recommend trusted weather sources\u2014BBC Weather or the Met Office\u2014since they\u2019re hyperlocal. Apps with hourly updates are best for London\u2019s fickle skies.  \n\n\u2026Wait, did they mean current weather or general climate? The question says \"like,\" which could mean either. I\u2019ll cover both: real-time (with a nudge to check live) plus typical patterns. That way, it\u2019s useful whether they\u2019re packing now or just daydreaming.\n</think>\n\nThe weather in London is famously **changeable**, but here's a general overview:\n\n1.  **Current Conditions (Requires Live Check):**\n    *   **I can't provide real-time weather.** My knowledge is current up to July 2024, but weather changes constantly.\n    *   **For the most accurate, up-to-the-minute forecast (temperature, rain, wind, etc.), please check a reliable weather service like:**\n        *   BBC Weather (London): [https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather)\n        *   Met Office (London): [https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)\n        *   A trusted weather app on your phone (e.g., AccuWeather, The Weather Channel).\n\n2.  **Typical London Weather (General Climate):**\n    *   **Temperate Maritime:** Mild but unpredictable.\n    *   **Mild Winters:** Rarely very cold (average highs 8\u00b0C/46\u00b0F, lows 2-3\u00b0C/36-37\u00b0F). Snow is infrequent and usually light, rarely lasting long. Frost is more common. Often cloudy and damp.\n    *   **Mild to Warm Summers:** Rarely very hot (average highs 22-23\u00b0C/72-73\u00b0F, but can reach 30\u00b0C/86\u00b0F+ during heatwaves). Evenings can be cool. Sunshine is common but not guaranteed.\n    *   **Rain:** Possible year-round, but usually light showers or drizzle rather than heavy downpours. Autumn and winter tend to be wetter. **Always carry an umbrella or light rain jacket!**\n    *   **Changeability:** The biggest feature! It's common to experience sunshine, clouds, and rain showers all in one day. Don't trust a sunny morning to last all afternoon.\n    *   **Seasons:**\n        *   **Spring (Mar-May):** Gradually warming, increasing sunshine, but still prone to rain and cool spells.\n        *   **Summer (Jun-Aug):** Warmest, longest days, most sunshine, but still variable. Can be humid.\n        *   **Autumn (Sep-Nov):** Cooling down, increasing rain and wind, beautiful fall foliage. Often considered the wettest season.\n        *   **Winter (Dec-Feb):** Coldest, shortest days, often grey and damp. Occasional frost/snow.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** London weather is **rarely extreme** but **highly variable**. **Always be prepared for rain and changing conditions, regardless of the season.** Checking a reliable forecast close to your visit or daily is essential!",

Are they planning a trip soon, or are they just curious? Since they didn't specify, I should cover both possibilities. \n\nFirst, I recall that London weather is pretty changeable. I should mention the variability so they're prepared. Maybe they want to know what to pack if they're visiting. The current forecast is essential, but I don't have real-time data. I need to explain that and suggest reliable sources like the Met Office or BBC Weather. \n\nI wonder if they're a tourist. If so, they might need tips on what to wear\u2014layers, an umbrella, comfortable shoes. Including those practical points could be helpful. Also, the seasons: summer highs, winter chills, rain chances throughout the year. They might not realize how cool summers can be compared to other places. \n\nShould I mention any common misconceptions? Like the stereotype of constant rain. London does get rain, but it's not as extreme as people think. Breaking that down could be useful. \n\nAlso, time of day matters. Mornings might be foggy, afternoons clearer. Including a note about checking forecasts close to their visit makes sense. \n\nI should structure the answer clearly: current weather (with a disclaimer), seasonal overview, what to expect, and sources. Keeping it concise but thorough. Make sure they know to verify closer to the date since weather changes fast there. \n\nHmm, did I cover all bases? Variability, seasons, rain, practical tips, reliable sources. Yeah, that should address both immediate needs and general knowledge. Avoid jargon, keep it friendly and informative.\n</think>\n\nLondon's weather is famously **variable and changeable**, but here's a general breakdown and what you need to know:\n\n1.  **Right Now (Important Note):**\n    *   I **cannot access live weather data** or provide real-time forecasts. Weather changes constantly.\n    *   **To get the *current* weather and an accurate forecast for the next few days, you MUST check a reliable weather service.** Excellent sources include:\n        *   The UK Met Office: [https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)\n        *   BBC Weather (London): [https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743)\n        *   AccuWeather (London): [https://www.accuweather.com/en/gb/london/ec4a-2/weather-forecast/328328](https://www.accuweather.com/en/gb/london/ec4a-2/weather-forecast/328328)\n        *   Weather.com (London): [https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/UKXX0085:1:UK](https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/UKXX0085:1:UK)\n\n2.  **What to Expect Generally (Based on Seasons):**\n    *   **Overall Character:** Mild compared to many places at similar latitudes, but unpredictable. **Always be prepared for rain and changing conditions.** Sunny spells can quickly turn to showers.\n    *   **Rain:** Rain is frequent but often light and intermittent. It rarely pours all day, every day. Drizzle is common. **Carry a small umbrella or a waterproof jacket year-round.**\n    *   **Seasonal Breakdown:**\n        *   **Spring (March-May):** Increasingly mild, but can be cool and wet, especially early on. Temperatures range from ~8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F) to 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F). More sunshine than winter.\n        *   **Summer (June-August):** Generally the warmest and sunniest time, but *not* guaranteed. Average highs are around 21-23\u00b0C (70-73\u00b0F), but can reach 28-30\u00b0C (82-86\u00b0F) during heatwaves (increasingly common) or stay cooler around 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F). Humidity can build. Evenings are cool. Thunderstorms are possible. **Packing layers is key.**\n        *   **Autumn/Fall (September-November):** Gradual cooling. September can still feel summery, but November is often cool, damp, and foggy. Temperatures drop from ~18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F) in Sept to ~9\u00b0C (48\u00b0F) in Nov. Rainfall increases. Beautiful leaf colours.\n        *   **Winter (December-February):** Generally cool to cold but rarely extreme. Average highs are 8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F), lows around 2-3\u00b0C (36-37\u00b0",

Here are some typical weather patterns:\n\n- **Summer (June to August)**: Average high temperatures range from 18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C (64\u00b0F to 75\u00b0F). It can be quite humid, and there's a chance of rain, even during the summer months.\n\n- **Autumn (September to November)**: Temperatures gradually decrease, with highs around 10\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 61\u00b0F). Rainfall increases, and there's a higher chance of overcast skies.\n\n- **Winter (December to February)**: The coldest months, with average temperatures ranging from 3\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (37\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). There can be frost and occasional snow, though it's not as common as in some other parts of the UK.\n\n- **Spring (March to May)**: Temperatures rise, with highs around 10\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 59\u00b0F). It's a transitional season with variable weather, and there's a good chance of rain.\n\nFor the most current and detailed weather information, you might want to check a reliable weather website or app, such as the Met Office, BBC Weather, or a similar service.",

Suggesting layers, an umbrella, and a light jacket makes sense. Maybe add that the weather can be unpredictable, so checking a forecast before going out is a good idea.\n\nWait, I should avoid making it sound like the weather is always bad. Emphasize that it's changeable but not necessarily unpleasant. Maybe mention the average temperatures in different seasons. For example, summers around 20\u00b0C and winters around 5\u00b0C. Also, note that it's common to have rain throughout the year.\n\nI should structure the response clearly: start with the current weather disclaimer, then describe the general climate, typical conditions, and tips for visitors.

I should note that the weather can be quite variable, with temperatures ranging from around 0\u00b0C in winter to 25\u00b0C in summer. Also, the city is known for its frequent changes in weather, so it's a good idea to mention carrying an umbrella.\n\nI should also highlight the factors that influence London's weather, like the Atlantic Ocean and the city's location. Maybe mention the \"London fog\" or how the city's geography affects weather. But I need to be careful not to overcomplicate it.\n\nAdditionally, I should offer to help with specific details if the user has a particular date in mind.
